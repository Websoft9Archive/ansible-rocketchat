# SMTP

Sending mail is a common feature for Rocket.Chat. After a large number of user practice feedback, only one way is recommended, that is, using the **third-party STMP service** to send the email.

> Do not try to install **Sendmail** or other Mail server software on your Cloud Server for sending mail, because it is very difficulty in maintenance.

Follow is the sample using **SendGrid's SMTP Service** to configure sending mail for RocketChat:

1. Log in SendGrid console, prepare your SMTP settings like the follow sample
   ```
   SMTP host: smtp.sendgrid.net
   SMTP port: 25 or 587 for unencrypted/TLS email, 465 for SSL-encrypted email
   SMTP Authentication: must be checked
   SMTP Encryption: must SSL
   SMTP username: websoft9smpt
   SMTP password: #fdfwwBJ8f    
   ```
2. Log in Rocket.Chat Console

3. Open【Administrator】>【Settings】>【Email】>【SMTP】, set it
